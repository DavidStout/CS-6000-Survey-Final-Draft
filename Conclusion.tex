\section{Conclusion}\label{sec-conclude}
Code comprehension is especially important in todayâ€™s environment of code reuse. Where instead of reinventing the wheel, developers are reusing code at a faster pace than ever before. While source code style guides, 
thorough commenting, and coding standards help make this an easier prospect there is no guarantee that they will be used on every project. The only guarantee is how the compiler will interpret the source, while the
human aspect is up to individual interpretation.

 Without being the original developer of the source,
future developers are relying on their comprehension of the source code. With our propensity for confusion, it is clear that there is a need for tools that can help with code comprehension. By using a combination of clarity metrics, code style guides, and deobfuscation methods code can become clearer and concisely interpreted by most developers.
